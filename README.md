# Periphery Plots

Patterns in temporal data can often be found across different scales, such as days, weeks, and months, making effective visualization of time-based data challenging. _Periphery Plots_ are a new approach for providing focus and context in time-based charts to enable interpretation of patterns across time scales. Our approach employs a focus zone with a time axis and a second axis, that can either represent quantities or categories, as well as a set of adjacent periphery plots that aggregate data along the time dimension, value dimension, or both dimensions. This repository contains a prototype implementation of Periphery Plots as a React component as well as demo of the technique.

## Running the Demo

This implementation requires the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install package dependencies and to run the demo.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Enter the directory `PeripheryPlots`.
3. Install package dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Build and launch the app via `npm start`.

## Preprint

A preprint describing the periphery plot data visualization approach in more detail will be available on arxiv.
